//	method 1:
//	A naive method is to run two loops. The outer loop will one by one pick array elements
//	from left to right. The inner loop will find the smallest element greater than the 
//	picked element on its right side. Finally, the outer loop will replace the picked 
//	element with the element found by inner loop. The time complexity of this method 
//	will be O(n2).
//	
//	method 2:
//	A tricky solution would be to use Binary Search Trees. 
//	We start scanning the array from right to left and insert each element into the BST. 
//	For each inserted element, we replace it in the array by its inorder successor in BST. 
//	If the element inserted is the maximum so far (i.e. its inorder successor doesn’t exist), 
//	we replace it by -1.
